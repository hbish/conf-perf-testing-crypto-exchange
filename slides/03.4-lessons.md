<!-- sectionTitle: 4. Know the limits -->
<!-- note
- Any application would have some sort of system constraints and the API we tested was no different and these limits should be factored in to the performance test
-->
### ⚠️
## Know the limits

---
<!-- note
- In our case each one of our API users had rate limiting, so we couldn't send huge amount of load from a single account, which meant we had to generate thousands and thousands of users and rotate as we run the tests.

- some other limits out there to consider include quota or ddos protection mechanisms which should be factored into your performance test suite where possible.

### Rate limiting
### Quota 
### DDOS protection

---
<!-- note
- In order to test rate limiting, we made a conscious decision to have 2 types of API clients in our tests. Fast users to simulate high frequency trading bots and slow users to simulate humans who automated submission of orders from excel spread sheet or other means.

- While its not necessary to build this into a performance test suite, in our case it made sense to ensure the rate limiting works as expected since its not something you can test in your functional tests especially if rate limiting is not build in the actual application and you use an API gateway.
