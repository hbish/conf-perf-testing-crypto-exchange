- So as I was coming here to DDDSydney today, I remember the time about 7-8 years ago when I was on a project where we had to recreate a few indexes in our database tables, I tested the change in our test and UAT environment and thought yay everything is working fine, all the application works as expected. And because I didn't know better at the time, I went ahead and requested to do the change on a friday afternoon. 

- Little did I know there are still plenty of activity in production during that time so when we were recreating the indexes, it took a very very long time, it got to a stage where the database ran out of temp storage and eventually hanged. Long story short, after an hour or so working with a DBA, we manage to fix the issue and that was my first experience with performance as a developer, albeit a very nasty one. It took away our weekday release privileges for the entire engineering team for about a year.

- YEAH A HUGE fail on my part but I have learnt a lot since then.

<!-- note
- Alright lets get the talk under way, with the industry evolving to have a strong focus on speed of delivery, there has been a heavy emphasis on unit-testing and integration testing to ensure our software is bug free and we can move fast without breaking things. 

- From my experience performance requirements are often been thought of either, 

1) very early on in an project but gets forgotten over time or 
2) towards the end of the project
3) it just doesn't exist

- And what worse is that the act of performance testing has always been a last minute exercise to get the software out the door. And when you do something last minute, you tend to do a really bad job at it. 

- So before I go any further on how we can try and fix this. I just want to make it clear that this is a talk about performance testing and not about how to get rich on cryptocurrency trading. I know my title is a bit clickbaity so sorry to disappoint.

- Also I just want to thank all the sponsors and organisers who make DDDSydney 2019 possible.

- And also a huge thank you to those of you in the room today for voting and giving me an opportunity to talk here today.
