<!-- note
- This is a talk about performance testing and how to get rich quickly on crypto. So no financial advises will be given. Sorry to disappoint.
- Before I start I just want to thank all the sponsors and organisers who make DDDSydney 2019 possible.
- And also a huge thank you to you guys in the audience today for voting and giving me an opportunity to talk here today.
