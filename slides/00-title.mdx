<!-- note
- Hi, so before I start I just want to make it clear that this is a talk about performance testing and not how to get rich on cryptocurrency. Also I'm not a financial advisor, so there wont be any financial advises. Sorry to disappoint.
- Also I just want to thank all the sponsors and organisers who make DDDSydney 2019 possible.
- And also a huge thank you to those of you in the room today for voting and giving me an opportunity to talk here today.
