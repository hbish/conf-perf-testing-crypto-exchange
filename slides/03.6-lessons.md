    Developed by statistician Francis Anscombe
    Dataset I appears to have clean and well-fitting linear models.
    Dataset II is not distributed normally.
    In Dataset III the distribution is linear, but the calculated regression is thrown off by an outlier.
    Dataset IV shows that one outlier is enough to produce a high correlation coefficient.
