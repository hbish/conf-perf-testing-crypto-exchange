## Test with a goal in mind

---
<!--note
- NFR - You should have it before you start testing
- Chances are you have already have NFR that was established at the very start of the project but just got lost
-->
## Non-Functional Requirements

<!--note
Without it, it can get very expensive. I have heard horror stories of people spending days and huge amount money build out tests that wasn't even testing the right thing.

## Expensive & Time Consuming

---
<!--note
- If you don't have it, either anticipate, just a finger in the air estimate
- or perform a preliminary breakpoint test ASAP to establish baseline
- If possible, ramp up the number of users until you observe increases in latency and response time, observe how the system behaves
- Use this initial data as your baseline
-->
## Benchmark! Benchmark! Benchmark!

## Without data you're just another person with an opinion
