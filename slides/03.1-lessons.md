- We will start of with a bit of an obvious one and that is performance test with a goal in mind

- This it really distill down to one thing and that is your non functional requirements

## Test with a goal in mind

---
<!--note 
- Yes I am talking about the non functional requirements that your architect or your product owner would have thought of right at the start of the project. But you probably would have forgotten it by now. 

- or maybe you never even had one to start off with. It which case you are in a bit of a pickle.

## Non-Functional Requirements

---
<!--note
- Because without non functional requirements, performance testing can get very very expensive, both from a time and a cost perspective. I have heard of horror stories of people spending weeks and weeks and huge amount money to build out these expensive test suites that wasn't even testing or measuring the right thing.

- In the case of my crypto exchange API, I never had a non-functional requirement to begin with, and when I asked my contact at the exchange, they had no idea how many people they were expecting to use their system and all I got was a vague answer of as many request as you can send.

## Expensive & Time Consuming

---
<!--note
- So rather than anticipating with a finger in the air estimate, what I did was I performed a preliminary benchmark on one of demo servers which wasn't as powerful as the production configuration.

- And there are several ways of doing this, you can test the system at different load 
 
- but the approach I took was with an breakpoint test. I created a very simple scenario in Gatling where I ramped up the number of users until I started seeing increases in latency and response time. Basically to the point where the system struggled to respond.

- This is important because I needed something to use as baseline to identify issues early and at the same time we can use the data we collected to check for performance regressions or improvements going forward
-->
## Baseline!

---
<!--note
- I love this quote, without data youre just another person with an opinion. 

- So without a baseline, I can't exactly say whether the API got better or worse.
