<!--note
- Now scaling your test is some thing you would think about when your application is going to be public facing. 
- Internal applications or services won't apply as much here.

## Scaling your performance test

---
<!--note
- You should focus majority of your time on the actual tests itself and not how to scale the test because there are already tools and platforms out there that can do it for you.
- The question you should be asking yourself first is, are you even ready to scale? It could be that your test already gives you a good enough indicator on how your API is performing, then scaling may not be a high priority.
- On the flipside if your tests are not giving you any valuable data or feedback then you should focus more on the tests and we've already talked about a lot of these earlier in the talk such as defining a goal, having appropriate monitoring and logging in place and ensuring your performance test suite make sense so that it exercises as many part of your system as possible.

## Focus on the actual test
### Scaling your test comes later

---
<!--note
- Here are some paid services out there, I'm sure there are many more. 
- Gatling Frontline obviously supports gatling quite nicely, you can deploy it yourself there is already a pre-made image on AWS which you can just spin up and pay by the hour. 
- Blazemeter and flood.io also supports gatling but in addition it supports a few other load testing tools like selenium, jMeter, ruby and element
- The features offered by these services are relatively comparable, reports all looks fairly nice, so definitely try it out before making a decision
- But if you are like me and find your use case or situation to be quite unique and complex, then you can absolutely scale your own performance tests

## Paid Performance Testing Platform

#### Gatling Frontline
#### BlazeMeter
#### Flood.io

<!--note
- So here is what we did at a very very high level
- We built a gatling image with all the dependencies preinstalled
- We check out the test suite via git when the ECS task gets initialized by our cloudformation script
- The test starts running as soon as the task becomes active and the results or simulation.logs in our case gets saved to a S3 bucket
- We leveraged a nice feature from gatling where you can append the simulation logs from different machines together to form a master report. If you are doing this yourself make sure you are not overriding the logs.
- and thats how we went about scaling our test and performing our live internet testing across 5 different regions, and each region had 5 instances creating load
