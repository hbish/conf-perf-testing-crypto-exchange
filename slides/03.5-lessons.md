## Things Devs might say

- "Get a bigger instance with more ram/cpu"
- "Just add more instances" 
- "It must be the database"
- "It's slow but it hasn't crashed yet"
- "Must be an environment issue"
- "Somethings wrong with your test suite"

let duration = start.elapsed();

println!("Time elapsed in submit_order() is: {:?}", duration);
