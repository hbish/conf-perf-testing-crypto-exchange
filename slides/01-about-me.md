<!-- note
- So a little about myself, I have been in the industry for just over 10 years

- I started off as a quality assurance engineer, predominately focusing on automation and performance testing

- Then I moved over to software development where I built and shipped code for about 7 years working in an investment bank and also through various projects in my role as a software consultant for Versent

- Recently I move to GROW Super as a software engineering manager where I am currently managing a team of about 20 engineers. 

- At GROW we believe in genuine and better financial wellbeing for all and we are doing this by building a new Superannuation Administration platform to help super funds to improve operational efficiency and reduce cost. This would translate to lower fees and greater returns to people like you and me. 

- I consider my move as a bit of a career change so I would love to hear from people who have made a similar transition. We are also hiring for backend/fullstack devs with experience in Kotlin and Vue. So if you see do me around after the talk, please feel free to come and have a chat with me.
