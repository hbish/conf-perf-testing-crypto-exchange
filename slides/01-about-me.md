<!-- note
- So a little about myself, I have been in the industry for just over 10 years
- I started off as a quality assurance engineer, predominately focusing on automation and performance testing on payment switching product
- Then I moved over to software development for about 7 years working with large enterprises in an investment bank and also through various projects in my role as a consultant for Versent
- At the start of the month I move to GROW Super as a software engineering manager where I am currently managing a team of about 20 engineers. At GROW we believe in genuine and better financial wellbeing for all and we are doing this by building a new Superannuation Administration platform to help super funds to improve operational efficiency and reduce cost. This would translate to lower fees and greater returns to people like you and me.
- As I just have start this transition into management, I would love to hear from people who have also made the transition. So if you see me around after the talk, please come up and have a chat with me.
