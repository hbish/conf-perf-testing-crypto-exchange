<!-- sectionTitle: 3. Functional Testing on Steroids -->
<!-- note
- and if you think about it, its kind of like doing functional testing on steroids

- so why stop there?

## Functional Testing on Steroids

--- 
<!-- note
- In gatling because its scriptable, we can actually perform some assertions as we are running the performance test without impacting on the performance results.

- This includes checking the response code is what you expect and if you really want to get smart about it, for example in our crypto API we can check that the order got executed and that the user balance is up to date
-->
### Add some asserts!

- response code
- check orders matched and reconcile with user balance 

---
<!--note
- but we took it to the next level, since we already had built some trading bots, we decided to also deploy them while the performance test is underway. 

- From a performance test result perspective a few additional requests doesn't affect the overall performance metric

- but we get the additional benefit of testing functionality while under load which is hugely important

- obviously this may not apply to you but if youre able to you could also run some functional test while your system is under load to check for any concurrency issues

### Trading Bots

additional functional tests while under load
