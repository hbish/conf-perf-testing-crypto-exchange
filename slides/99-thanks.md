<!-- sectionTitle: Wrap up -->
<!-- note
- So some key takeaways from today

- Performance testing is not purely non-functional testing, it can be an extension of functional testing, if you can get the tests and assertions going

- Test with a goal in mind and understand that your intuition may not always be correct, collect as much data as possible to help with your analysis

- and remember statistic can sometimes work against you.
-->
## Takeaways

- Performance Test != Non-Functional Testing
- Know your parameters and limits upfront
- Test with the end in mind
- Forgo any assumptions and verify using performance metrics
- Stats Lie!

<!-- note
- also a shameless plug, I maintain a list of performance testing tools on github along with some cool articles and conference talks of performance.

- If you are also interested in performance then please check it out and contribute!
